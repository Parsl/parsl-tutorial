In case of long running functions it may not be desirable to wait for completion, instead it is preferable that functions are executed asynchronously. Parsl provides such asynchronous behavior by returning a future in lieu of results. A future is essentially an object that allows Parsl to track the status of an asynchronous task so that it may, in the future, be interrogated to find the status, results, exceptions, etc.\n",

When invoking an app, Parsl requires that a list of output files be specified (using the `outputs` keyword argument). A DataFuture for each file is returned by the app when it is executed.
